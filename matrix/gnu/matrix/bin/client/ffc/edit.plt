# Downloads
# The code for all numbered listings is available for download from www.manning.com/
# books/gnuplot-in-action-second-edition, and so are the data sets. The only exception
# to this are publicly available data sets: for these, I provide the URL where they can be
# found.
# Gnuplot searches for data files in the current directory, so the easiest way to run
# the supplied command files is as follows:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Change into the data directory of the downloaded bundle.
# Start gnuplot.
# Issue plot commands at the gnuplot prompt the way theyâ€™re shown in the text
# (for example, plot "marathon" using 1:2), or give the full pathname to the
# gnuplot command file that you wish to run (for example, load "../gnuplot/
# shapes.gp").
